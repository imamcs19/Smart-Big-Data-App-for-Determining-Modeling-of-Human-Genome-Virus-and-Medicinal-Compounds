Smart Big Data App for Determining Modeling of Human Genome, Virus and Medicinal Compounds to Healing any Disease Especially for Covid-19 by meta-Deep AI Reinforcement Learning Using Core Engine Container System ( Real datasets taking from the NCBI web independently (First, on Human data, in the form of complete Human Genome sequence data which is data on healthy or normal humans without being exposed to diseases or any viruses and also Human Genome sequence data that have Cancer disease or are exposed to SARS-CoV2 Virus or the others. Then, the second, on virus data, in the form of SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and MERS sequence data) is done, but medicinal data is still being collected from hospital in Malang, helped by a lecturer from the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya (FKUB) and collected from books also and from trusted online sources. In Syaa Allah the complete real dataset will be used in the 3rd stage of research (this is the final stage), namely in 2022. ) 

Keywords: smart big data, modeling, human genome, virus, covid-19, medicinal compounds, meta-deep ai reinforcement learning; core engine container system
